# Chess game
##### Written all in Ruby; runs in console with some slick prompting

![c9](http://cloud9ide.zendesk.com/system/photos/0001/0216/5694/logo_thumb.png) You can play the game live on Cloud9 [here](https://ide.c9.io/haseeb_qureshi/ruby-chess). The login is *guestaccount*, password *guestaccount*.

### Features:
* Save/load games
* Chess AI which uses rough cost-benefit heuristics to make decisions
* Computer/Human Players
* Colorized UI, W-A-S-D input
* Highlighting of all potential moves
* Very OOP (all pieces inherit from common Piece class, and include "Steppable" and "Slideable" modules to modularize sliding/stepping movement logic)
* It works! Play it by your lonely, lonely self!

###### Note: I'm good at coding chess, not so much at playing.
